## Retired Fonts
These fonts were used previously during the design process but have been replaced:

- **Birthstone Bounce**: The original script font used for hero sections. Replaced by *Le Jour Script* for a more premium look.
- **Allison**: Previous script font used for subtitles. Replaced by *Montserrat* for better legibility and contrast.
- **Playfair Display**: Previous serif font for headings. Replaced by *Cormorant Garamond* for a sharper, more elegant feel.
- **Pinyon Script**: Considered but not used in the final design.
