        "At Untamed Blooms, we believe flowers are more than decoration — they are emotion made visible. Each design is crafted as a vivid expression of life’s raw beauty: imperfect, fleeting, and unforgettable.",
        "Our arrangements are bold, soulful, and alive — created to stir something deep within you. Inspired by courage, resilience, and wild surrender, they mirror wildflowers breaking through after a storm: unexpected, unrefined, and achingly beautiful.",
        "This is floral design as an awakening — a call to embrace the messy beauty of life, honor the moments that shape us, and reconnect with what truly matters."

    quote: "Every bloom tells a story of love, loss, and renewal. Let Untamed Blooms awaken your wild spirit, reminding you that beauty thrives in the chaos, and it’s in our most vulnerable moments that we truly come alive.",
